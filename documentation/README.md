# Documentation of Ably Asset Tracking Android SDKs

The [`publisher.dot`](publisher.dot) and [`subscriber.dot`](subscriber.dot) files in this repository contain graphs (in [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) DOT format) documenting the relationships between various operations in the Android Asset Tracking SDKs.

They are based on the Android codebase at commit `2e490ab`.

They contain directed graphs, whose nodes represent operations and edges represent operation invocations. They donâ€™t (currently, at least) document the sequencing of operation invocations or any conditional logic.

The operations covered are of the following types:

- worker queue workers
- methods of the `Ably` wrapper interface
- `Publisher/SubscriberInteractor` methods
- `CorePublisher/Subscriber` public methods
- `CorePublisher/Subscriber` private methods
- `DefaultSubscriber` public methods

This documentation is only intended to be informative, to help newcomers to the project get a rough idea of the key components of the SDK and how they interact.

## Viewer app

There is a web app in [`viewer`](./viewer) for viewing the graphs and generating useful subgraphs. See the [Readme](./viewer/README.md) for more information.
